					<h4>Problem Context</h4>
					<p>Although our core reservation management product was not geared towards events, our support and account management team frequently received requests to create events from our restaurants. In 2018, we received over 600 event requests. While we knew there was interest in merchandising and managing events through Resy, we had yet to understand how much time and effort to invest.</p>

					<br>

					<p> To gauge to level of interest, we launched a V0 events feature in early 2019. After we launched the V0 events feature, we saw nearly 700 events created in Q2 alone. While interest was high, initial data from V0 also pointed towards several usability issues and feature needs. For example, a top business goal in early 2019 was to increase the number of financial transactions through Resy, however only 25% of events were pre-paid.</p>

						<h4>Initial Research</h4>
						<p>While many event products exist in the market, none cater towards culinary experiences and targeted a restaurant user base. What to build and how much effort to invest was ambiguous and open-ended. To better understand the problem, I conducted interviews with 9 restaurants and shadowed 2 event series.</p>
					</div>

					<p class="flex-col">
						Sharing the research with my team, I led a journey mapping exercise where we wrote down insights from each interview on sticky notes and began grouping into themes. Once my team had an understanding of restaurants problems and goals, I set out to align with stakeholders on the next phase of our Events product.

								<p>Events allow restaurants to reward regulars and convert new diners to regulars.</p>

								<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-2.png" alt="Insight">
								<p>Events are an expensive venture and some restaurants have trouble selling out and turning a profit without proper marketing tools.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="flex-horizontalimg">
								<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-3.png" alt="Insight">
								<p>Events are concept-driven and this determines how they are sold (price point, guest count, etc).</p>

						<div class="flex-col">
							<p>Restaurants run events in a variety of formats:</p>

						<h4>Design Details</h4>
						<p>I tackled designs in 3 phases: event creation workflow, event management dashboard, and event check-in experience.</p>
					</div>				
				</div>

				<div class="flex-row">
					<div class="flex-col">
						<h4>Creating Events</h4>
						<p>As a restaurant's main line of business is events, hosting an evens involves several major decision points with regards to normal dine-in service. I anchored event creation based on event formats to give users a guided workflow for each. I also used existing workflow conventions so managing an event felt just as familiar as running normal service. Early usability tests showed that we were heading in the right direction and pointed out areas of improvement.</p>

						<h4>Managing Events</h4>
						<p>From the moment tickets go on sale to the moment guests enter the door, restaurants are looking at a variety of factors and metrics to guide changes in ticket quantity, price point, menu options, and more. I designed a dashboard that allowed restaurants to easily track sales and manage changes.</p>

						<h4>Day of Event</h4>
						<p>One of my favorite parts of this project was designing the day of check-in experience. During my event shadows, I noticed that the start of a General Admission events was the most hectic and long check-in lines were often a point of frustration for guests. While our need was too custom for native Apple controls, I wanted to interaction to still feel familiar. After many iterations, I landed on a fun swipe to check-in experience that achieved the goal of a quick and seamless check-in experience.</p>

						<h4>Full Party Check-In</h4>
						<p>Swipe right to quickly check in multiple guests who purchased tickets together. Restaurants loved this feature as other event platforms require checking in each individual guest, however most culinary event tickets are purchased by party.</p>

						<h4>Partial Party Check-In</h4>
						<p>Quickly check in partial parties and track how many guests have left to arrive. Guests frequently do not arrive with their full party and tracking this per party for events was previously a huge painpoint with our existing reservation management tool.</p>

							<h4>Beta Testing & Learning</h4>
							<p>We launched the events product to beta in time for Valentine’s Day 2020 - one of the single largest revenue driving nights of the year. This was the first time Resy conducted a formalized beta test for a feature launch. I led research for the initial beta phase with 12 restaurants ranging across major markets and different tiers of restaurants. We required that restaurants involved in this beta phase participate in several calls with me throughout different touchpoints of their events. Through this process, we were able to identify and quickly address launch blockers, bugs, and usability issues. It also led to a backlog of feature improvements that we are continuing to work through. Below are a few insights from the beta test.</p>

							<div class="flex-horizontalimg">
								<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-1.png" alt="Insight">
								<p>Restaurants are repeat users - an average of 3 events were created per venue.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="flex-horizontalimg">
								<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-2.png" alt="Insight">
								<p>Restaurants are frequently experimenting with new event concepts and formats, even after ticket sales are live, resulting in a high number of changes.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="flex-horizontalimg">
								<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-3.png" alt="Insight">
								<p>Restaurants are not utilizing option to save events as draft and are instead going live right away to see their event page.</p>

							<h4>Launch</h4>
							<p>Soon after we rolled out this feature to all restaurants, the covid-19 pandemic hit and restaurants across the globe were forced to close. While the events feature hasn’t been used in the capacity we expected, this tool has provided restaurants with alternative ways to market and manage alternative revenue streams such as takeout, virtual events, and more. The usage of this feature has exceeded my teams' expectations and led to signficant increases in usability metrics as well as a 3X increase in pre-paid events, helping Resy hit revenue targets each quarter.</p>
