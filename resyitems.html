					<h4>Problem Context</h4>
					<p>In mid-March 2020, states announced stay-at-home orders that turned the restaurant industry on its head. With many restaurants forced to close dine-in or reduce capacity, there was a pressing need for alternative revenue streams.</p>

					<br> 

					<p>While some restaurants turned to delivery platforms like Doordash and Seamless, many restaurants felt that the payout of delivery was not enough to not rationalize the effort. Additionally, many Resy restaurants wanted to pursue more creative ideas but traditional delivery systems lacked the functionality.</p>

				<div class="flex-col">
					<h4>The Team</h4>
					<p>I drove the conversation from discovery, to scoping, and delivery with restaurant partners, product / engineering management, and account management. I led research and executed restaurant-facing designs. My restaurant and consumer feature teams each consisted of a PM and team of 3 engineers (front-end web, iOS, and back-end) and I worked closely with my consumer design counterpart.</p>

						<h4>Initial Research</h4>
						<p>My team quickly set out to understand how restaurants were adapting to COVID, painpoints with existing solutions, and to explore what Resy's role could be in this difficult time. We conducted conversations with 8 restaurants. Below is a summary of key insights:</p>

						<div class="flex-horizontalimg">
							<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-1.png" alt="Insight">
							<p>Restaurants don’t want to offer the standard, lackluster take out experience and are instead exploring how to bring an elevated restaurant experiences at home.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="flex-horizontalimg">
							<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-2.png" alt="Insight">
							<p>Special dining experiences are an opportunity to both extend their hospitality and brand into guests’ homes, while enabling higher spend and likely higher margins.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="flex-horizontalimg">
							<img class="horizontal-img" src="images/resyevents/number-block-3.png" alt="Insight">
							<p>There are no tools to execute. A tool that would allow restaurants the flexibility to showcase their creativity and package these experiences as unique and branded would be the key to success.</p>
						</div>

						<br>

						<p>With a solid understanding of the problem at hand, we set out to build a flexible solution that enables restaurants to easily setup, manage and deliver culinary experiences beyond traditional dine-in.</p>

						<h4>Defining the Solution</h4>
						<p>I led conversations across product, design, and engineering to better define our solution. To deliver value quickly, I pushed my team to think of how we could break out the solution into smaller chunks of work while building foundations for later phases. Our approach was to launch in phases that also represent the functional evolution of the user’s journey in creating, managing, and delivering their add-ons. I also worked closely with our engineers to ensure each phase of the data model could support the long-term strategy for this feature.</p>

						<h4>Design Exploration & Usability Tests</h4>
						<p>After initial design explorations, I conducted remote usability tests with 4 restaurants to validate our approach. Usability tests focused on tasks on each part of the user’s journey in creating, managing, and delivering add-ons. Early feedback showed we were heading in the right direction and helped us further scope the first phase.</p>

						<h4>Phase 1: Designing for Basic Add-Ons</h4>
						<p>The goal of the first phase of work was to enable creating and selling multiple items per reservation, pickup option, or event. To enable this functionality across any inventory type, I designed the feature to be modular so it can be added to any page or flow in our dashboard. The item creation flow is a simple form that can be triggered from and saved into an item library that can be searched and accessed across the dashboard.</p>

						<h4>Phase 2: Designing for Advanced Menus</h4>
						<p>In phase 2, we unlocked better guest marketing with categories and the ability to create advanced menus. I redesigned the empty state around category templates based on top item scenarios. Early feedback from restaurants indicated that having control over each detail was key to packaging these experiences as unique and branded so we introduced re-ordering and additional content capabilities.</p>

				<div class="flex-row">
					<div class="flex-col">
						<p>Throughout each phase, I also continued to design updates to our iOS app. As the app is geared towards in-service management, the main goal was design a simple booking experience for restaurants and to streamline distribution of items during service.</p>

							<h4>Pilot Program & Launch</h4>
							<p>We launched each phase into a pilot program and saw great adoption throughout. Since launch, this feature has impacted over $120K in supplemental pre-paid revenue. This feature has also been instrumental in helping restaurants optimize supply planning as nearly 42% of items are not pre-paid. Below are a few notes from restaurants regarding the impact of this feature:</p>
